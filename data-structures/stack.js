// A stack is a commonly-used data structure in computer science. From Wikibooks (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Structures/Stacks_and_Queues):

// First implement a constructor function for a Node. Each node should have a value property and a next property. Value should be whatever is passed to the function and next should default to null.
function Node(val) {
}

function Stack() {
  // Your stack should be implemented with the following properties

  // first - this should point to the last node in the stack
  // last - this should point to the last node in the stack
  // size - this should be the number of nodes in the stack
}

// push - takes in a node and puts it at the top of the stack. Should return the new size of the stack.
Stack.prototype.push = function(val) {

}

// pop - removes the node at the top of the stack and returns the value of that node. 
Stack.prototype.pop = function() {
  
}

// peek - returns the first value in the stack
Stack.prototype.peek = function() {

}
